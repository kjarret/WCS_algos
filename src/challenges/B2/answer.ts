/**
 * In this challenge, you have to get all the images sent in a conversation (list of messages).
 * Images must be sorted by message datetime they are attached to (recents first, if datetimes are the same, should be sorted by content length).
 * You should not display duplicates. If duplicates are found, the recent one should be kept.
 * This algo is useful to create a medias gallery in a conversation app (such as in WhatsApp conversations)
 *
 * @param messages List of messages with their images
 * @returns All existing images sorted by their parent datetimes (recent first), without duplicates
