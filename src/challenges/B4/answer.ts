/**
 * In this challenge, you have to regroup messages into an array of day based on their
 * sentAt property, messages in a day must be sorted by their sent at prop (oldest first)
 * The main array must be sort chronologically by their day dates (oldest first)
 * You have to manipulate dates in vanillaJS. Be carefull to call, if needed, setUTCHours, setUTCMinutes, ...
 * instead of setHours, setMinutes, ... to avoid timezone offsets!
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: [{ content: "Hi there", sentAt: "2020-11-17T10:38:01.021Z" }, { content: "Hello", sentAt: "2020-11-17T11:45:01.721Z" }, { content: "It's a new day", sentAt: "2020-11-18T10:38:01.021Z" }]
 * Output: [
 *      {
 *          day: "2020-11-17T00:00:00.000Z",
 *          messages: [
 *              { content: "Hi there", sentAt: "2020-11-17T10:38:01.021Z" },
 *              { content: "Hello", sentAt: "2020-11-17T11:45:01.721Z" },
 *          ]
 *      },
 *      {
 *          day: "2020-11-18T00:00:00.000Z",
 *          messages: [
 *              { content: "It's a new day", sentAt: "2020-11-18T10:38:01.021Z" },
 *          ]
 *      },
 * ]
 *
 * @param messages List of messages, unsorted and not grouped in days
 * @returns Sorted list of days (only days with messages!) with a list of sorted messages of the day
