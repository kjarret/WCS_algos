/**
 * In this challenge, you will get the opening slots of a company by day of
 * the week (1 being Monday, this is the iso week day). You have to create
 * a function that returns the planning of the opening hours of the company for
 * a precise day, hour by hour. If there is an ambiguity for a given hour
 * you should consider so company to be closed.
 *
 * We ensure that opening slots are valid (the opensAt time is before closesAt,
 * no need to check that).
 *
 * Tip: opening slots are not sorted chronologically!
 *
 * BONUS: too easy? You may do the very same exercice but returning a 30 minutes slots
 * planning instead of a 60 one.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: {
 *  openingSlots: [{ "isoWeekday": 1, "opensAt": "09:00", "closesAt": "12:00" }, { "isoWeekday": 1, "opensAt": "14:00", "closesAt": "19:30" }],
 *  isoWeekday: 1
 * Output: [
 *     { fromTime: "00:00", toTime: "01:00", status: "closed"},
 *     { fromTime: "01:00", toTime: "02:00", status: "closed"},
 *     ...,
 *     { fromTime: "09:00", toTime: "10:00", status: "opened"},
 *     ...,
 *     { fromTime: "19:00", toTime: "20:00", status: "closed"},
 *     ...,
 *     { fromTime: "23:00", toTime: "00:00", status: "closed"},
 * ]
 *
 * @param openingSlots List of opening slots of the company
 * @param isoWeekday Number of the day in the week we want the planning for (1 being Monday)
 * @returns The planning with the status of each slot of the given day, a slot being 60 minutes
